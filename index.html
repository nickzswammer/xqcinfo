        <p><b>Dallas Fuel</b></p>
        <p>On October 28, 2017, Overwatch League franchise Dallas Fuel announced Lengyel would be joining their roster as their 9th player. Lengyel played with the team for several matches before coming under fire due to homophobic remarks made on his Twitch stream directed against rival player Austin "Muma" Wilmot of the Houston Outlaws. Lengyel was suspended by the League for four matches and fined $2,000 for violating the Overwatch League Code of Conduct. The Dallas Fuel later extended the suspension to include the entirety of Stage 1. Lengyel made his return at the beginning of Stage 2, leading his team to victory against the Los Angeles Gladiators, and was chosen as Omen by HP's Player Of The Match. Shortly after his return to the Dallas Fuel lineup, Lengyel received a second suspension and fine for multiple social media violations and use of disparaging language towards the Overwatch League casters.</p>
        
        <p><b>International Career</b></p>
        <p>
            Lengyel also played for Team Canada in their 2017 Overwatch World Cup campaign. They qualified for the World Cup after beating the Netherlands by a score of 3-0. The team made it all the way to the finals of the tournament before being defeated by defending champions, South Korea. Lengyel was named the event's most valuable player.

In the 2018 Overwatch World Cup, Lengyel played as a main tank on the starting roster for Team Canada. <br><br>Several months prior to the world cup, the head coach of team Canada, Justin "Jayne" Conroy announced on his Twitch stream that Lengyel, along with players Lucas "NotE" Meissner, Brady "Agilities" Girardi, Lane "Surefour" Roberts and Liam "Mangachu" Campbell, would be welcome to join the Canadian national team without going through the regular trialing process. He played in the Los Angeles Group Stage, finishing second place to move on to the quarterfinals at BlizzCon.

In July 2019, Team Canada announced that Lengyel would return as the starting main tank for the team at the 2019 Overwatch World Cup. The team did not manage to pass the Group Stage after losing all four of its matches.

        <h3><u>Streaming</u></h3>
        <p><b>Twitch</b></p>
        <p>
            In the wake of the suspension of the Legion's 2020 Contenders season, Lengyel chose to continue streaming full-time on Twitch. He streams for an average of 9 hours every day and has a viewer count that regularly exceeds 60,000. In October 2019, Lengyel was the most watched Twitch streamer and ranked as the 29th most followed. In addition, he is one of the most subscribed to Twitch channels, having over 35,000 monthly subscribers on average. While he still plays Overwatch, his streams are currently more focused on variety. He often browses new releases on Steam and plays games based on suggestions from his viewers. Lengyel also does IRL (In Real Life) streams for events like TwitchCon, BlizzCon, and he has also done PO Box Openings, Media Share Streams, Viewer PC Set-Up Reviews and has even opened Pokémon booster boxes on stream.

On February 2, 2019, Los Angeles-based esports organization Sentinels signed Lengyel to their Twitch content creator roster as a variety streamer. The signing announcement also shared that Lengyel would be joining Overwatch esports team Los Angeles Gladiators as a substitute player. On August 27, 2020, Lengyel was released from his Sentinels contract and later signed to Luminosity Gaming.

<br><br>In March 2020, Lengyel was invited by Riot Games to take part in the Valorant closed beta where viewers could obtain a beta access key by watching his stream. Between April 7 and 15, he streamed more than 112 hours of Valorant, which included 3 streams that lasted for more than 20 hours. He also reached his current all time peak in viewers (222,720) and total unique viewers in one stream (1,971,819) on April 9, 2020.

Towards the end of March 2020, Lengyel started playing chess on stream. <br><br>On April 2, fellow streamer and Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura came on his stream to teach him how to play chess. In the following months, Lengyel would include chess games in most of his streams where he attempted to improve his Chess.com rating. Clips from him playing chess began to gain traction on Reddit, especially on the subreddit r/LivestreamFail, and got other streamers to gain interest in the game. On May 25, Chess.com announced the first of the PogChamps events, where 16 streamers would compete in a chess tournament for a prize fund of $50,000. Lengyel ended up in the consolation bracket after losing every game in the Group Stage, but won against fellow streamer Fuslie in the quarterfinals. He was defeated in the semifinals by Ludwig Ahgren. Lengyel's collaboration with Nakamura and the subsequent PogChamps events are widely believed to have inspired the surge in popularity of chess on Twitch and other media platforms, such as YouTube.

On October 1, 2020, Lengyel announced on his stream that he had signed to Luminosity Gaming as a content creator.
